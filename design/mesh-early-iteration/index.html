                    <p class="dropcap">MESH is an online community for the Kenyan biz space. It fuses social networking, skill sharing, and job opportunities to give young entrepreneurs a leg up.</p>
                    <p>I began working with MESH in early 2022 as the sole UI designer. With no existing style guide, I updated the interface with an iterative visual language and built out a component library to easily scale across the app. We also began to design new features&#8239;—&#8239;I would build a prototype based on a user story, UX would test, and I would iterate.</p>
                    <h2 id="initial-refresh">Initial visual refresh <a href="#initial-refresh" class="anchor-link">#</a></h2></h2>
                    <p>When I first started at MESH, I was asked to refresh the design of the app. It had been built without a complete style guide and lacked coherence. This early refresh was meant to modernize and refine the app without taking too sharp a departure from the existing identity.</p>
                    <p>Without previous documentation, the live site served as guidance for a baseline. I constructed a functional color palette that felt familiar to the existing palette; specified type styles and how to use them; and harmonized our icon set by handpicking a selection of Microsoft's Fluent UI Icons, which strike a good balance of professionalism and approachability.</p>

                    <p>We also reimagined the experience for MESH’s training modules. The Learn page is one of the most important parts of the app, designed to help give users the skills they need to start and grow their own businesses.</p>
                    <p>I placed the modules front and center&#8239;—&#8239;no longer buried below a wall of text&#8239;—&#8239;and adopted a design more familiar to users of streaming apps. A “Continue learning” section lived up top if a user had started any module, followed by recommendations, categories, and curated lists. Selecting any module presented a large button to jump right into the training, with included videos and supplementary materials listed below.</p>
