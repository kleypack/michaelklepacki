                    <p><span class="small-caps">Some of my earliest memories</span> are of my grandfather. I’m not even sure if they are real memories, or simply my imagination, spurred by his reminiscence, run wild.</p>
                    <p>But I remember him taking me to McDonald’s for a happy meal, and especially our trips after to the park to feed the ducks. I remember his little white truck. I know he babysat me and took care of me when I was brand new to this world.</p>
                    <p>I remember his big glasses and I remember so clearly the smell of his aftershave. His mischievous grin and the love in his smile.</p>
                    <p>I remember the elevator at Coronado Mall and the way he, for years, blamed my dad for nearly suffocating us all inside it. He was a dirty liar.</p>
                    <p>I remember him pulling quarters out of my ear and when I asked him how he did it he would simply say, “Magic,” and I knew there must be some trick to it and yet I kind of believed him because, to me, he was magic.</p>
                    <p>I remember him taking me and my sister to the pool when he was there for my graduation; when he was back for my sister’s graduation and we made him try on hats&thinsp;—&thinsp;not the caps he always wore but silly, cutesy, frilly ones&thinsp;—&thinsp;and we placed flowers in his hair. I remember his playfully scornful look and his boundless patience for us, his grandbabies.</p>
                    <p>And I realized, too, that he shaped my life. He was a lover of movies, maybe the biggest I knew. His shelves and shelves of DVDs captivated me. I remember going to the Suds & Cinema and the taste of the popcorn&thinsp;—&thinsp;still the best I’ve ever had&thinsp;—&thinsp;and the pizza&thinsp;—&thinsp;decidedly not the best I’ve ever had.</p>
                    <p>One of my favorite memories is when he took us to see <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, and there was a float done up to look like a pirate ship in the parking lot, from which they were giving out gold coins (chocolate) and Mardi Gras beads&thinsp;—&thinsp;which for some reason made perfect sense for pirates when I was 10 years old. A film, I, heading into fifth grade, loved, based on a Disney World ride that I had ridden with him. Again, magic.</p>
                    <p>I believe his love of movies played a role in my journey into the very heart of the world of film, my own love of motion pictures. I am sure that for much of my professional life, he had no idea what it is I did. But I know that when he saw that my name was on-screen, in the credits of something he could watch from his own, favorite chair, he was proud.</p>
                    <p>I hope that he was proud. For all of his jokes about the powers of a Klepacki ID card, and for all of my own conflicted feelings about legacy and generational inheritance, I hope that he is proud. Proud that I bear his last name. Proud of the family he raised (imperfectly&thinsp;—&thinsp;yes), took care of, chose to be there for.</p>
                    <p>For so much of my life, Papa was the only extended family I had. When I was jealous of my friends with their big families and their reunions and all their cousins and aunts and uncles and grandparents . . . I didn’t have much, but I always had my Papa. He was always there. For me, he was there from the beginning. I have never known life without him, and it doesn’t seem right for him to be missing from it now.</p>
                    <p>I miss him. And I love him so much. I hope he knows how much he meant to me, his grandbaby.</p>
                    <p>I love you, Papa.</p>
