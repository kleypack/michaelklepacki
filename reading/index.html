								<p>Reaffirms my feeling that this is the weakest of the books. Has some exciting moments near the end&thinsp;—&thinsp;the Aragog encounter is genuinely creepy, and much of the finale is at least more coherent than in the film&thinsp;—&thinsp;but most is rather a slog. Plot holes and incredulous character decisions abound, but most unfortunate is just how <em>much</em> time Rowling spends rehashing all the setup and development from its predecessor. I know it’s a children’s book, but there is an elegant way to recap (see <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i>), and then there’s this.</p>

								<p>I could never properly rate or review these&thinsp;—&thinsp;not with all the nostalgia for adventures that quite literally shaped my childhood; not with all the disgust of the betrayal of the author and her too-oft-spouted abhorrent views.</p>
								<p>Yet for all that these books will, not without complication, always remain special to me. Some things struck me revisiting the first now&thinsp;—&thinsp;a subtle, vindictive sort of mean streak, for one, and many other things that have been pointed out countless times which flew right over my head reading this at an age younger even than Harry and his friends. Through 30-plus-year-old eyes there is much to be gleaned and plenty to take issue with; but the story, the setting, the friendship&thinsp;—&thinsp;pure magic.</p>
								<p>We must never forget, unlike the author, that the most powerful magic stems not from money or power or hatred or fame, but from <em>love</em>.</p>

								<p>A collection of short, horror folk tales, mostly wonderfully illustrated with a perfect palette. As will all anthologies, some stories are stronger than others. I particularly loved the first and the last; and the third, “His Face All Red”, was particularly fun after having just finished Hellebore’s Mirror issue.</p>

								<p>Nearly perfectly paced and wonderfully spooky. The atmosphere sets in immediately, thick as fog rolling in from wooded hills. Having seen and loved a few of the Hammer adaptations, I was pleasantly surprised to see just how faithfully and lovingly they adapted the source; much of the camp and sexuality of those films actually comes straight from the text. Carmilla and Laura are so clearly enamoured with each other beyond mere friendship. Carmilla is as much an obsessed, codependent lover as a cat playing with her food; and Laura is obviously terrified not only of the few truly frightening encounters she experiences, but also of the intensity of her mutual, forbidden infatuation.</p>
								<p>The anagrammatic names are quite silly, sure, and the conclusion is wrapped up a little awkwardly and too quickly. But it’s beautifully written, full of repressed lust and genuine, nightmarish horror. There was no way I wouldn’t love this.</p>
								<p>(I read this almost entirely by candlelight past midnight. Highly recommend.)</p>

								<p>Such a simple, massive story told in captivating prose. At once a meditation, a meticulous log of minutiae, and a grand epic. There is real emotionality not only in the existential musings but also the clever decision to set the 24-hour orbit amidst an encroaching typhoon on the Earth’s surface and a personal loss. A wrenching, beautiful work. </p>

								<p>Sure, Pacino isn’t much of a writer, but that’s not why you’re here, is it? Sonny Boy delivers where it counts. It’s full of anecdotes from throughout his life, and it’s honest and personal; reflective in the best sense and revelatory. Al Pacino is not the characters we best know him for. Many people who’ve met him can tell you this, but it’s another thing to get the first-hand confirmation.</p>
								<p>This is not a celebrity tell-all (though there are a handful of delightful anecdotes). Not even, really, a vanity project. It’s strikes me, firstly, as a love letter to his craft. If you’re of the impression that actors are too self-important, too up their own asses, this probably won’t dissuade you of that. But Pacino isn’t celebrating himself; he’s celebrating work that he loves and finds truly essential. I’m of course inclined to agree with him, so this really worked on me.</p>
								<p>I was struck by the ending as he grapples with age and existence, wondering how he can be so old but still feel so young—mentally, that is. I sometimes feel this way already, in my thirties—the disconnect of body and mind can be so disconcerting. And now I’m out of the realm of a review and veering off into personal reflection and rambling. Hey, I’m not much of a writer either.</p>

								<p class="book-rating five-star favourite">★★★★★</p>
								<p>I was told that the Netflix series (which I haven’t seen) is nearly a complete departure from the book, and I can see why. <em>Hill House</em> is a perfect bit of literary horror, wherein so much of the terror arises directly from the writing. Many of the visuals, even back in the sixties, were effective but nothing that hadn’t been dreamt up before. But it’s the way these visuals reveal themselves within your mind’s eye, the way discoveries and events unfold on the page, that shocks. The choice of what to describe and what to leave up to imagination; the unreliable, nightmarish narration that seamlessly slips in and out of concrete reality; the descriptions that leave you off-kilter before sending chills throughout your body; it’s not what unfolds, but how it unfolds.</p>
								<p>We do follow lively characters in a vivid setting, and it’s a funny, heartbreaking story with many layers waiting to unfold. But it’s Jackson’s prose that takes this from very good to a masterpiece.</p>

There is so much that can and has been read into this, so many strands to pick and pull, so many angles to approach this from. Jackson’s prose is so lively and wonderfully eerie in its first-person narration. Feels timeless in the best of ways. Makes me thrilled to explore more of her novels, and even more so to revisit this one many times to come.</p>

								<p>I found all of these at least good, and a few even great, but as a whole not as transformative as some reviews may have led me to anticipate. I imagine individual response to this will be deeply personal, and while my own is rather surface-level, I am glad to have read it.</p>

								<p>Interesting and insightful, though never quite as urgent as its title implies&thinsp;—&thinsp;the subtitle should serve as a sign that things are going to get heady. Unfortunately the deep philosophical and historical musings of Stay leave it feeling cold, even as it attempts to explore the very depth of humanity and present a case a for its significance. A meaningful thought exercise, sure; but, in my eyes, fails at its stated mission of making an impactful case for why&thinsp;—&thinsp;even from within the depths of despair&thinsp;—&thinsp;we should choose life at every turn. Such persuasion I believe takes more emotion than this deeply intellectual text can provide.</p>

								<p>An exercise in frustration. The author was so concerned with making it clear she’d thought of every little detail and nuance of the world she’s created, she seemingly forgot to tell a story&thinsp;—&thinsp;right up until it’s nearly too late. The vast majority of <em>A Deadly Education</em> consists of clunky narration over-explaining every mundane facet of the deadly school in which the novel is set. Short breaks are taken for the narrator to complain about how unfair it is that everyone hates her even though all she’s only ever been is completely rude and unpleasant. Which is a shame, because the world is actually quite fun! But every character&thinsp;—&thinsp;and especially the writing&thinsp;—&thinsp;is almost universally anything but. There is just absolutely no room for anything subtle here. It all feels so graceless and abrasive. A plot does finally start to kick in about two-thirds through&thinsp;—&thinsp;though the exposition dumps never do cease&thinsp;—&thinsp;and I found myself finally curious, if not enraptured. Things take a small and hopeful turn near the end, only for the novel to end on a twisty cliffhanger. I’ll say I’m tempted to hate-read the next in the trilogy, but for now I need a break. Truly baffled by all the praise that was heaped upon this.</p>

								<p>Honestly think I read about a third of this too late at night and had trouble, in a state of stupid half-consciousness, following the heady language and conspiratorial plot. But damn is <em>Dune Messiah</em> compelling and tragic. A classic sequel in that it carries on the themes of the first&thinsp;—&thinsp;all of the messianic foreboding and psychedelic weirdness&thinsp;—&thinsp;and turns it all up to eleven. It takes a pivot, though, in genre, trading most of the adventurous action for quieter, political intrigue. Yet it retains much of the excitement and inventiveness of its predecessor. I think this one could grew on me even more with a revisit. (I feel the same about the first.) But first, I’m excited to continue on with the next books in the series, even if this does seem to offer a satisfying end to the story of Paul Muad’Dib.</p>

								<p>Recently saw the film adaptation and wanted to revisit Judy Blume&thinsp;—&thinsp;haven’t read anything from her in years and never got around to <em>Are You There God</em>. A rare instance where I think the film lovingly expands upon and improves the book. Still, Blume’s original work remains a lovely and refreshingly honest look at growing up and the societal pressures of school and religion. It certainly shows its age with its heteronormativity, both in gender roles and sexuality, but I think it’s safe to say it’s still quite progressive at heart. It may not represent everyone, but it feels real and true for many.</p>

								<p>Purposefully not a step-by-step guide, but rather a broad strokes manifesto. Full of critical and thoughtful&thinsp;—&thinsp;if, at times, obvious&thinsp;—&thinsp;meditations on the war being waged on our attention, our warped human-centric societal viewpoint, and our history of destructive “progress.” In fact it’s the examination of our history&thinsp;—&thinsp;and the power imbalances and injustices that have persisted throughout&thinsp;—&thinsp;that struck me me most, having expected a much narrower focus on modern topics like the 24-hour news cycle and social media addiction. This, refreshingly, is so much more than that. Even as it points out just how much we as a species have managed to destroy and tarnish, <em>How To Do Nothing</em> somehow stays beautifully hopeful. It really does have me looking at the world and my place in it differently&thinsp;—&thinsp;I only hope that I can resist distraction and actively allow the invigoration to last.</p>

								<p>Almost certainly the longest book I’ve ever read, and yet I wouldn’t want it to be any shorter. Every single page is earned. The utter mastery of the pacing, the world- and character-building, the emotionality, is incredible. Considered knocking off half a star for the frequency of physical descriptions of the women characters, but just couldn’t bring myself to do it. Though be aware that it’s there. Sexuality and desire, though, end up being key themes of the book, and it’s a nuanced, thoughtful approach and appreciation. The book is scary, yes, and violent. But what sticks with me most is the warmth of It. It is, at its heart, a story about friendship and love. About adolescence and memory and time. It is deeply thoughtful, nostalgic, and hopeful. Dark in content but so bright in theme and pathos. It is of course, a masterpiece. And It is a work of love.</p>

								<p>A little too pop-sci/aggressively hopeful for my taste, though effective at times. The descriptions of the main character’s suicidal depression read to me as written by someone who’s never actually experienced it themselves. I’m not about to slap a “problematic” label on this, but I imagine if I had read this in the depths of depression, I may have hated it. Luckily though, in my quite healthy current state, I found it charming, if a bit simplistic and predictable. I had to push through some quibbles in the fantasy mechanics for the first half or so, but it was worth it to go along for the ride. If you’re familiar with depression, you already know a book isn’t going to save your life. But it’s worth a read if you want some momentary shift in perspective, or a gentle reminder that there’s a lot of potential out there in the world, and inside us all.</p>

								<p>Surprisingly lovely, subtle variations in voice across the stories. Some of those work better than others, but I enjoyed the book more and more as it went on&thinsp;—&thinsp;though that may have been a matter of resetting expectations.</p>

								<p class="book-rating">★★★&thinsp;½</p>
								<p>A fascinating collection of contradictions. Progressive (for the time) writing of sexuality, with conservative sexual ideals. Biting criticism of capitalist society that often still feels relevant today, delivered in a preachy, classical manner. Very pro-sex, but only the traditional, heteronormative sex Lawrence holds as holy. A disdain for vapid intellectualism, but descriptions of sex that read far more spiritual and  heady than steamy and physical. (Though some post-coital scenes are written with an intimacy that ring true.) A flawed and fascinating read, with still plenty to offer today.</p>

								<p>Finally finished the entire book, including the appendices. The first half of Appendix A nearly turned me off, but I’m so glad I pushed through as the world-building is fascinating.</p> 
								<p><i>Fellowship</i> is still my favourite of the three (I re-read it many times as a kid, but never revisited Two Towers and I don’t believe I ever fully finished <i>RotK</i>), but I’m so glad to have finally completed the whole series. It is, of course, masterful. This, amazingly, might actually take my number two slot from <i>Two Towers</i>. Not that the ranking really matters, of course&thinsp;—&thinsp;it’s a beautiful tale all the way through.</p>
